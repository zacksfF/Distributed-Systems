Transaction commit is closely related to Byzantine failures. A transaction consists of a collection of atomic operations. The successful commit of a transaction is dependent on all operations succeeding together.
SO An atomic commit is indeed a commit protocol used in distributed systems. It ensures that a group of changes, or updates, to data across multiple nodes in a distributed system are either all applied successfully or all rolled back, even if failures or errors occur during the process.

## Table: Commit versus Byzantine problem.

| Commit problem | Byzantine problem |
| --- | --- |
| 1. All processes must agree. | Some processes agree |
| 2. It must tolerate many faults. | Tolerates many faults (at most nâˆ•3). |
| 3. It should not produce wrong answers, either no answer or answer. | Gives random answer if fault threshold is exceeded.|
| 4. Agreement may require unbounded time. | Requires bounded time. |
| 5. No extra processes, only a few extra messages. | Extra processes and many messages |

## key points about atomic commit:
**Working principle**: Typically, the protocol involves a coordinator node coordinating with participant nodes to prepare changes, vote on commit/abort, and then broadcast the final decision.

**Importance**: Atomic commit is crucial for maintaining data consistency in distributed systems, especially when dealing with transactions that involve updates to multiple databases or resources.

**Applications**: It finds applications in various areas, including database management systems, distributed file systems, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.

## Types of atomic commit
#### Two-Phase Commit Protocol
The Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol is a fundamental mechanism used in distributed database systems to ensure data consistency across multiple servers. It acts like a voting system to guarantee all participating databases either complete a transaction (commit) or revert all changes (abort) in a synchronized manner.

**Phase 1: Prepare**

1. **Coordinator Initiation:** A coordinator, which is a designated server managing the transaction, initiates the process by sending a "prepare T" message to all participating databases involved in the distributed transaction (T).
2. **Local Preparations:** Each database receiving the message checks if it can commit the transaction locally. This might involve tasks like acquiring necessary locks or ensuring sufficient resources to complete the transaction.
3. **Voting:** If preparations are successful, the database sends a "ready" vote back to the coordinator. Otherwise, it replies with a "not ready" vote.

**Phase 2: Commit/Abort**

1. **Decision Time:** The coordinator analyzes the votes from all participants.
    - **Commit:** If all votes are "ready," the coordinator broadcasts a "commit T" message to all participants, instructing them to finalize the transaction changes.
    - **Abort:** If there's at least one "not ready" vote, or the coordinator doesn't receive a response from a participant within a timeout period, it broadcasts an "abort T" message, instructing everyone to undo any local changes made during the "prepare" phase.
2. **Completion:** Upon receiving the commit or abort message, each participant performs the designated action and updates its local logs to reflect the outcome.

The most straightforward algorithm that solves atomic commitment is the two-phase commit (2PC). It solves the weak atomic commitment in the presence of both link and process failures. In the absence of failures, all the processes eventually decide. However, the biggest problem of 2PC is that it blocks when failures occur.

##### Here are some additional points to consider:

- 2PC introduces some overhead due to the two-phase communication.
- The protocol can become a single point of failure if the coordinator malfunctions.
- Alternative protocols like Three-Phase Commit (3PC) offer solutions for specific scenarios where 2PC might have limitations.

#### Three-Phase Commit
Three-Phase Commit (3PC) is an enhancement of the Two-Phase Commit (2PC) protocol designed to improve fault tolerance in distributed transactions. It builds upon the core idea of 2PC but adds an extra phase to address the potential issues of a single point of failure and blocking.

Here's how 3PC works:

**Phase 1: Can-Commit**

1. **Coordinator Inquiry:** The coordinator initiates the process by sending a "can-commit T" message to all participants involved in the transaction (T).
2. **Participant Decision:** Each participant assesses its readiness to commit the transaction based on local conditions and responds with either "yes" or "no" to the coordinator.

**Phase 2: Pre-Commit**

1. **Coordinator Decision:** If all participants respond "yes," the coordinator broadcasts a "pre-commit T" message to all participants.
2. **Participant Preparation:** Upon receiving the pre-commit message, participants prepare for committing the transaction. This might involve making necessary changes to local data but not permanently applying them.

**Phase 3: Commit/Abort**

1. **Decision Point:** Here, 3PC deviates from 2PC. The coordinator doesn't directly issue a commit or abort message. Instead, it performs one of these actions:
    - **Commit:** If the coordinator receives pre-commit acknowledgements from a predefined number of participants (assuming reliable communication within this group), it broadcasts a "commit T" message, instructing everyone to finalize the transaction.
    - **Abort:** If the coordinator detects a failure (participant crash, timeout, or negative responses in phase 1), it broadcasts an "abort T" message, instructing everyone to undo any local preparations.
2. **Completion:** Participants execute the final commit or abort instruction based on the received message.

**Benefits of 3PC:**

- **Improved Fault Tolerance:** By introducing the pre-commit phase, 3PC avoids the coordinator becoming a single point of failure. Even if the coordinator crashes after sending pre-commit messages, other participants can determine the next step based on their pre-commit acknowledgements.
- **Reduced Blocking:** Unlike 2PC, participants in 3PC aren't blocked waiting for the coordinator's final decision in the commit phase. This can improve overall transaction throughput.

**Drawbacks of 3PC:**

- **Increased Complexity:** The additional phase adds complexity to the protocol compared to 2PC.
- **Relies on Assumptions:** 3PC assumes a network with bounded delays and reliable communication within a specific participant group. In real-world scenarios, these assumptions might not always hold true, leading to potential inconsistencies.
