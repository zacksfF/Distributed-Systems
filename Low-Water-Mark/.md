In distributed systems, a Low-Water Mark (LWM) refers to a specific point within a write-ahead log that indicates the safe minimum threshold for discarding older log entries.  Think of it as a marker in the sand. Overall, the low-water mark is a valuable concept in distributed systems for managing resources, balancing loads, and ensuring fault tolerance by dynamically responding to changing conditions.

Here's how it works:

- Distributed systems often rely on write-ahead logs to ensure data consistency and recover from failures. These logs record all the changes made to the system.
- However, storing all the logs forever can be impractical due to storage limitations.
- The Low-Water Mark helps determine which parts of the log can be safely discarded without compromising data integrity.

There are two main uses of Low-Water Marks:

1. **Log Management:** The LWM acts as a signal to the logging system. Any entries before the LWM can be safely deleted because they've already been processed and the system has reached a stable state beyond that point.
2. **Data Synchronization:** In scenarios where multiple systems need to stay in sync, the LWM can be used to identify changes that have occurred since the last synchronization point. This allows systems to efficiently retrieve only the most recent updates, improving efficiency.

## Problem

The write ahead log maintains every update to persistent store. It can grow indefinitely over time. Segmented Log allows dealing with smaller files at a time, but total disk storage can grow indefinitely if not checked.

### Snapshot based Low-Water Mark

Most consensus implementations like Zookeeper, or etcd (as defined in RAFT), implement snapshot mechanisms. In this implementation, the storage engine takes periodic snapshots. 

Along with snapshot, it also stores the log index which is successfully applied. Referring to the simple key-value store implementation in the Write-Ahead Log pattern, the snapshot can be taken as following:

```go
func takeSnapshot() Snapshot {
    snapShotTakenAtLogIndex := wal.getLastLogIndex()
    stateBytes := serializeState(kv)
    return Snapshot{State: stateBytes, LastLogIndex: snapShotTakenAtLogIndex}
}
```

### Time based Low-Water Mark

In some systems, where log is not necessarily used to update the state of the system, log can be discarded after a given time window, without waiting for any other subsystem to share the lowest log index which can be removed. For example, in systems like Kafka, logs are maintained for 7 weeks; all the log segments which have messages older than 7 weeks are discarded. For this implementation, each log entry also includes the timestamp when it was created. The log cleaner can then check the last entry of each log segment, and discard segments which are older than the configured time window.
