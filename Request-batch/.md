In distributed systems, request batching is an optimization technique used to improve efficiency when sending requests to a server or service. It involves combining multiple individual requests into a single, larger request before sending it over the network. 

## Problems and solutions

When requests are sent to cluster nodes, if a lot of requests are sent with a small amount of data, network latency and the request processing time (including serialization, deserialization of the request on the server side) can add significant overhead.
For example, if a network’s capacity is 1gbps and its latency and request processing time is, say, 100 microseconds, if the client is sending hundreds of requests at the same time — each one just a few bytes — it will significantly limit the overall throughput if each request needs 100 microseconds to complete.


``Here are some common problems encountered in distributed systems and their potential solutions:`` 

**Problem: Network Latency and Bandwidth Limitations**

- **Solution:**
    - Implement request batching to reduce the number of network requests.
    - Use data compression techniques to reduce the size of data sent over the network.
    - Consider caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data locally on nodes, reducing network traffic.

**Problem: Single Point of Failure (SPOF)**

- **Solution:**
    - Implement redundancy by deploying multiple instances of critical services across different nodes.
    - Utilize leader election protocols to automatically elect a new leader in case the current leader fails.
    - Design systems with loose coupling to avoid cascading failures.

**Problem: Data Consistency Issues**

- **Solution:**
    - Implement data replication to ensure data consistency across different nodes.
    - Use consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos to ensure all replicas agree on the order of updates.
    - Employ eventual consistency models for scenarios where strict consistency is not essential but high availability is desired.

**Problem: Security Vulnerabilities**

- **Solution:**
    - Secure communication channels with encryption (e.g., TLS) to protect data in transit.
    - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
    - Regularly patch software vulnerabilities and keep systems updated.

**Problem: Scalability Challenges**

- **Solution:**
    - Design systems for horizontal scaling by adding more nodes to handle increased load.
    - Utilize sharding techniques to distribute data across multiple nodes for efficient retrieval and updates.
    - Implement load balancing strategies to distribute incoming requests evenly across available nodes.

**Problem: Debugging and Monitoring Challenges**

- **Solution:**
    - Implement distributed tracing to track requests across different components of the system.
    - Use logging frameworks to capture system events and diagnose issues.
    - Employ monitoring tools to track resource utilization, performance metrics, and potential errors.

**Use Cases:**

- **API Calls:** When a client application needs to fetch multiple pieces of data or perform actions on a backend service, request batching can significantly reduce network traffic and improve performance.
- **Database Updates:** Batching database writes can improve efficiency by minimizing round trips to the database server.

**Pros:**

- Reduces network traffic
- Improves server processing efficiency
- Can potentially improve overall latency

**Cons:**

- Individual requests experience slightly higher latency due to batching
- Requires additional logic on both client and server sides to implement

## This approach offers several benefits:
**Reduced Network Overhead:**

- Instead of sending multiple smaller requests individually, each with its own network overhead (headers, routing information), request batching reduces the total number of network packets transmitted.

**Improved Server Processing:**

- Servers can often process multiple requests within a single batch more efficiently than handling them individually. This is because servers can potentially optimize internal operations by processing requests in a batch instead of incurring context switching overhead for each individual request.

**Reduced Latency:**

- While each request might experience slightly higher latency due to waiting for the entire batch to be sent, the overall latency for processing multiple requests can be lower compared to sending them individually due to the reduced network overhead.
